# M7SFP
This is my blog site.

I've tried blogging a few times in the past, without much success.
This time I'm going to try blogging about electronics, adventures in amateur
radio, software development and anything else that takes my fancy in the
amateur radio world.

I am currently a member of the [RSGB](https://rsgb.org) and [AMSAT-UK](https://amsat-uk.org) and will update this
list as I join new associations.

73's
